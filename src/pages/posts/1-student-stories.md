# Student stories

Before my son attended Parity, it's fair to say that we were beside
ourselves with worry for his future. After the school system, people
like my son are left high and dry and it's very frightening. I was
lucky enough to meet a client who attended Parity and then the sun
came out and it's shone ever since.
